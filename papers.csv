Sentiment Analysis for Software Engineering: How Far Can We Go?,Bin Lin; Fiorella Zampetti; Gabriele Bavota; Massimiliano Di Penta; Michele Lanza; Rocco Oliveto,2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),"Sentiment analysis has been applied to various software engineering (SE) tasks, such as evaluating app reviews or analyzing developers' emotions in commit messages. Studies indicate that sentiment analysis tools provide unreliable results when used out-of-the-box, since they are not designed to process SE datasets. The silver bullet for a successful application of sentiment analysis tools to SE datasets might be their customization to the specific usage context. We describe our experience in building a software library recommender exploiting crowdsourced opinions mined from Stack Overflow (e.g., what is the sentiment of developers about the usability of a library). To reach our goal, we retrained-on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow-a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative. We changed our focus and performed a thorough investigation of the accuracy of these tools on a variety of SE datasets. Our results should warn the research community about the strong limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.",2018,10.1145/3180155.3180195,IEEE
Pattern-Based Mining of Opinions in Q&A Websites,Bin Lin; Fiorella Zampetti; Gabriele Bavota; Massimiliano Di Penta; Michele Lanza,2019 IEEE/ACM 41th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),"Informal documentation contained in resources such as Q&A websites (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a precious resource for developers, who can find there examples on how to use certain APIs, as well as opinions about pros and cons of such APIs. Automatically identifying and classifying such opinions can alleviate developers' burden in performing manual searches, and can be used to recommend APIs that are good from some points of view (e.g., performance), or highlight those less ideal from other perspectives (e.g., compatibility). We propose POME (Pattern-based Opinion MinEr), an approach that leverages natural language parsing and pattern-matching to classify Stack Overflow sentences referring to APIs according to seven aspects (e.g., performance, usability), and to determine their polarity (positive vs negative). The patterns have been inferred by manually analyzing 4,346 sentences from Stack Overflow linked to a total of 30 APIs. We evaluated POME by (i) comparing the pattern-matching approach with machine learners leveraging the patterns themselves as well as n-grams extracted from Stack Overflow posts; (ii) assessing the ability of POME to detect the polarity of sentences, as compared to sentiment-analysis tools; (iii) comparing POME with the state-of-the-art Stack Overflow opinion mining approach, Opiner, through a study involving 24 human evaluators. Our study shows that POME exhibits a higher precision than a state-of-the-art technique (Opiner), in terms of both opinion aspect identification and polarity assessment.",2019,10.1109/ICSE.2019.00066,IEEE
